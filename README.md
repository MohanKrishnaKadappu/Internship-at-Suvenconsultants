Performing Analysis Of Meteorological Data
October 18, 2020
 One type of data that’s easier to find on the net is meteorological data. Many sites provide historical data on many meteorological parameters such as pressure, temperature, humidity, rain, Apparent Temperature, Wind speed, visibility, etc.

 The goal of this project on Data Analysis is to transform the raw data into proper useful data and then convert it into proficiency.

I am super excited to share with you my first internship project. So, let's begin !!

>>Weather Dataset

Import of Weather Dataset

The Null Hypothesis H0 is “Has the Apparent temperature and humidity compared monthly across 10 years of the data indicate an increase due to Global warming”

The H0 means we need to find whether the for the month say April starting from 2006 to 2016 and then for the same period have increased or not.



I.  First we have to describe our dataset, Check whether any null value is present or not, and Analyse the data type of column is perfect or not.


Checking irregularity in the Dataset

II.  Before we move on to visualization, We have to convert formatted date to date type[data type is date].
Data - type changed to date type

III.  Now, here data is in the hourly period of time. So, we had to resample the data monthly for clear-cut analysis.
Resampling of the data in monthly
IV. 
According to the below plotting of Humidity vs Apparent temperature, we can clearly say that humidity throughout the last ten year [2006–2016] remain unchanged. But there is a sine wave culture seen in temperature which is quite normal according to as per our three main seasons.




We need to find whether the for the month of a month say April starting from 2006 to 2016 and then for the same period have increased or not. The below graph shows humidity vs temperature for April month for ten years.

So, Humidity remained the same for all year but for [the year 2009, 2011,2015 ] there is a major difference shown as compared to the average temperature ratio.





V. Below plot for humidity for all ten years [2006-2016]







VI. Below plot for Temperature measurement for all ten years [2006-2016]



VII. I have also analyzed the graph of humidity vs temperature for all 12 months.
Which as shown below Number vice:

(1) January: We can clearly see how a huge change in temperature is created where humidity is similar throughout the year.





(2) February: We can clearly see how a huge change in temperature is created and humidity is unchanged.





3-March, 4-April, 5  -May, 6-June, 7-July, 8-August, 9-September, 10-October, 1 1-November,  12- December.




Conclusion:
According to the January -, December graph visualization, April to August Month's temperature change is very frequent[less] It's almost the same for all year. But there is no change in humidity for the last 10 years [2006 - 2016] for a particular month. Once more, from September to March, there is a huge change in temperature but humidity is unchanged.

I am really thankful to the team of Suvenconsultants for providing me this opportunity to showcase the given problem statement and giving coding internship. Thank you Suvenconsultants.
